# 🔐 Encrypted Password Manager with GUI

A secure and simple password manager built with Python and Tkinter. It generates strong passwords, stores encrypted credentials locally, allows searching, copies passwords to clipboard, tracks frequently used sites, and uses a master login for protection.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Master Password Login**  
  Only authorized users can access the app using a hashed master password (SHA-256).

- 🔏 **Password Encryption**  
  Passwords are securely stored using **AES encryption** via the `cryptography` module (`Fernet`).

- 🔑 **Password Generator**  
  Generate strong, random passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.

- 💾 **Save Login Info**  
  Store credentials (website, email, password) in an encrypted JSON file.

- 🔎 **Search Credentials**  
  Instantly retrieve saved login information with a built-in search.

- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard**  
  Generated passwords are automatically copied to your clipboard for quick use.

- 📊 **Track Usage**  
  Tracks how often each website is accessed and displays the top 5 most-used ones.

- 🖼️ **Modern UI**  
  Clean and responsive GUI built with Tkinter and styled with a dark theme.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
cd password-manager
````

### 2. Install Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install cryptography pyperclip
```

### 3. Generate a Secret Key (only once)

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
with open("secret.key", "wb") as key_file:
    key_file.write(key)
```

### 4. Set a Master Password

Hash your master password and replace the `MASTER_HASH` in the script:

```python
import hashlib
print(hashlib.sha256("your_master_password".encode()).hexdigest())
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Passwords are encrypted using AES (Fernet).
* Master password is hashed using SHA-256.
* Data is stored locally; no external databases are used.
* Consider adding **key rotation** and **multi-user support** for future upgrades.

---

## 🛠️ To-Do

* [ ] Encrypt the entire JSON structure, not just passwords
* [ ] Add password strength indicator
* [ ] Support for password updates/deletion
* [ ] Cloud backup support
* [ ] Auto-lock after inactivity
